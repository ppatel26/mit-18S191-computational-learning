## Introduction to Computational Thinking for Real-World Problems - HW Solutions

This repo holds my HW solutions for the MIT's 18.S191 course. 

<sub>(from class syllabus)</sub>
> This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking, using the modern `Julia` programming language, to approach real-world problems in the following areas via data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling. In this class you will learn applications, computer science, software, algorithms, and mathematics as an integrated whole.
>- Image analysis
>- Particle dynamics and ray tracing
>- Epidemic propagation
>- Climate modeling
